This is super important, as this helps us be an ever-growing community, where we help one another achieve any goal that comes to mind, regardless of their coding level.\n\nHere's what we came up with:\n\n- Be nice. We love the atmosphere, and we love seeing how much everyone enjoys helping one another. We firmly believe that we should safeguard this culture—this is our space and we should protect it. We have different skills and  different challenges, so don't forget that each one of us was once a code baby :)\n- Do not repeat questions. Use the forum search. There's a great chance that someone has already solved the problem that you are facing. \n- Use meaningful titles. ‘How can I create a collapsing and expanding repeater?’ is a much better title than ‘Help please!’. This makes it easier for people to spot the posts that they can help with.\n- Use Hashtags. makes it #easy #to #follow #topics.\n- Multiple short posts are better than a long one. This allows other people to benefit from our posts after we're done with it. Keeping posts short makes it easy to find answers, and makes the post relevant for more people.\n- Keep questions focused and clear. This will make each question easier to solve, which makes it possible for more people to answer it.\n- Format the text in your question. Use Code blocks, bullets, etc. to make it easier to understand.\n- Refrain from posting a long code. Debugging code is difficult enough when it's a short one. Post only relevant part of code.\n- Provide as many details as possible. Share what you think is right, what you’ve tried to do, and what blocks you. Include any relevant screenshots, code, and URLs to make it easier for others to understand the problem.\n- Acknowledge our peers’ help by marking a 'Top Comment' for the best answer. This will also make it easier to spot the correct answer.\n\n\nLast but not least: WORK HARD, PLAY HARDER!. Have fun in the process ;)\n\n","userEmail":"kekikum@segtaj.gh","creationTime":1545880457898,"labels":["Corvid","Guidelines"]},{"id":"ab6fc754-0e01-5cfb-84b9-cf37c1c0cdb5","title":"Collapse/expand code affecting the page footer\n","content":"I have placed collapse/expand code onto one of my pages, but the footer now has a huge white space above it in the preview.

Instead, the video URLs are blocked, resulting in a 403/CORS error.\n\nSince videos are bandwidth intensive, I can see why Corvid would be careful with them, but it seems they went a bridge too far when a Wix/Corvid page cannot access Wix/Corvid stock videos.\n\nMaybe I'm overlooking something I can do on my end, but this looks very much like a problem on the Wix end of things.\n\nWix/Corvid has server settings that allow page background image changes in the onReady() part of pages. But, it prohibits page background videos to be changed the same way as the images.\n\nLooks like a Wix/Corvid system error to me (or a flawed policy), not a feature.\nSince this is a suspected bug, I sent it to tech support.\nThey told me to place the concern in the forums - the usual circular reference games.\n\nAny assistance with this matter is greatly appreciated. \n","userEmail":"rujruvjiv@uw.mx","creationTime":1526445637085},{"id":"6358ae3f-0eb4-5bea-aae2-dd358e0c3988","title":"Dynamic Header","content":"I was hoping that someone would know how to make a header resize once scrolling. \n \nThis would be the main header (at the top of the page).
